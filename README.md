# python-minesweeper
Python Minesweeper is a simple Minesweeper clone that can be played straight through the terminal.

## Usage
Simply change your directory inside the terminal to a folder with the following files:

- `start.py`
- `game.py`
- `functions.py`

and execute the program with the command `python start.py`.

You will be prompted to choose a difficulty. The default difficulties are `Beginner`, `Intermediate` and `Expert`, but you can choose the number of rows, columns and mines using the `Custom` difficulty.

You can now begin playing. You can choose to "click" on a cell, or to place a flag on a cell. You win when you "click" on every single cell that does not have a mine, and lose if you "click" on any cell with a mine.

The number of flags is equivalent to the number of mines, and the total points are equivalent to the number of cells subtracted with the number of mines.
